# There's a Better Version
This project is being archived because I built a much better version in a different repo/project. You can check that out here:
[https://github.com/richjdsmith/middleman-tailwind-webpack](https://github.com/richjdsmith/middleman-tailwind-webpack)

# middleman-tailwind-stimulus
A starter Middleman 4.2 project with StimulusJS and Tailwind CSS set up and served via webpack.


To get it working, just run `yarn add` and it should go.
